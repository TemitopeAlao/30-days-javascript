# 30 Days of JavaScript

This is a personal challenge to build **1 small JavaScript project each day for 30 days**.

Each project is saved in its own folder with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

I'm doing this to stay consistent, improve my problem-solving skills, and get better at writing clean code from scratch.

---

## 📌 How It Works

- No frameworks or libraries — just **Vanilla JS**
- Each day = a new folder + a simple project idea
- Some are built from scratch, some inspired by challenges/tutorials
- Some projects might not be responsive (especially early ones)

---

## ✅ Goals

- Practice consistently
- Think through how to break problems down
- Build muscle memory for DOM and JS logic
- Keep track of growth over time

## 📂 Project List

| Day | Project Name     | Folder            |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Digital Timer    | `01-timer`        |
| 2   | Simple Piano App | `02-piano`        |
| 3   | modal window     | `03-modal window` |
| 4   | BMI Checker      | `04-bmi`          |
| ... | ...              | ...               |

_(I'll keep updating this list as I go.)_

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I'm Doing This

I'm still learning JavaScript and wanted a hands-on way to practice what I learn.  
This challenge helps me stay accountable and track how far I’ve come.

## 🔒 Disclaimer

These projects are for practice only. Some ideas are inspired by online examples, but I rebuild them from scratch to learn better.
