        I'm TemiðŸ‘‹, a content writer turned frontend developer-in-progress. I
        started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. <br />It wasn't
        always smooth, I've struggled with consistency and fought through doubt,
        but Iâ€™m still here, building, breaking, and rebuilding. <br />
        This modal isn't just a window. itâ€™s a snapshot of my learning growthðŸ’¥.
